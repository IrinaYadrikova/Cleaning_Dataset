# Cleaning_Dataset and Data Analysis Demonstration Project

This project is created for demonstration purposes, to showcase my ability to work with data and perform SQL queries for data cleaning.

## Purpose
The main objective of this project is to demonstrate how I can efficiently clean and analyse data using SQL. Throughout the project, I focus on various data-cleaning techniques, ensuring the dataset is prepared for further analysis or reporting.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Cleaning**: I applied multiple SQL queries to clean and normalize the dataset. This includes handling missing values, standardizing data formats, and removing duplicates.
- **SQL Skills**: Demonstrated proficiency in writing complex SQL queries, including joins, aggregations, and subqueries, to clean and prepare data for analysis.

## Tools Used

- **SQL**: For data extraction, transformation, and cleaning.
- **PostgreSQL**: As the database management system.
- **PGAdmin**: This is for managing and querying the database.
